		"longDescription" : "In Windows, there's a control panel, dialog box, administrative console, API, or wizard to manage every component of your system. There are    thousands    of them   so many that it can be nearly impossible to keep track of all the locations and settings you need to administer Windows effectively. For administrators, PowerShell is a godsend because it provides a single, unified command line from which you can control and automate every aspect of Windows. PowerShell finally enables Windows administrators to work in a way that Unix and Linux administrators have leveraged for decades.    Like classic administrative shells, PowerShell accepts and immediately executes typed commands. In addition, it has all the features of a full-fledged programming language built in, so you can create scripts to automate even the most complex tasks. And it's fully aware of all the components of Windows and most Windows servers, so you can use PowerShell to control Exchange, IIS, SharePoint, and other core pieces of your Windows system.    Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches is an innovative tutorial designed for busy administrators. Author Don Jones has taught thousands of administrators to use PowerShell, and now he'll teach you, bringing his years of training techniques to a concise, easy-to-follow book.

		"longDescription" : "Windows has an easy-to-use interface, but if you want to automate it, life can get hard. That is, unless you use PowerShell, an elegant new dynamic language from Microsoft designed as an all-purpose Windows scripting tool. PowerShell lets you script administrative tasks and control Windows from the command line. Because it was specifically developed for Windows, programmers and power-users can now do things in a shell that previously required VB, VBScript, or C#.    Windows PowerShell in Action was written by Bruce Payette, one of the founding members of the Windows PowerShell team, co-designer of the PowerShell language and the principal author of the PowerShell language implementation. From him you will gain a deep understanding of the language and how best to use it, and you'll love his insights into why PowerShell works the way it does.    This book is a tutorial for sysadmins and developers introducing the PowerShell language and its environment. It shows you how to build scripts and utilities to automate system tasks or create powerful system management tools to handle the day-to-day tasks that drive a Windows administrator's life. It's rich in interesting examples that will spark your imagination. The book covers batch scripting and string processing, COM, WMI, and even .NET and WinForms programming.",

By leveraging a trio of established technologies-Silverlight, XNA, and C#   developers can blend what they already know about Windows development with the new opportunities and challenges presented by a mobile platform. And with exciting new Windows Phone devices rolling out now, the demand for WP7 apps is just starting to build.

Along the way, you'll discover why Microsoft opted for Silverlight and XNA as the core technologies for WP7. As with Silverlight for the desktop, you can create stunning visual effects using C#. Silverlight for Windows Phone has been enriched with navigation services, a new execution model to better satisfy mobile requirements, and hooks for embedding a browser, playing media files, running cool animations, and more.    The XNA Framework provides libraries to handle 3D graphics, audio, and touch input. Because games are a key target of mobile app development, by the end of the book you will be able to write your own XNA game, utilizing the unique input abilities of the phone. You also learn how to tune your game code to get the best performance while running in the phone's constrained environment.",
